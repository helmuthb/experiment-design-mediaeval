## Introduction - Paper2

AcousticBrainz Genre Task 2018: Genre and subgenre prediction of unkown music recordings (songs)

Detail: Content-based musicgenre recognition using genre annotations from multiple sources and large-scale music features data available in the AcousticBrainz database.

## Approach - Paper2

Title: MediaEval 2018 AcousticBrainz Genre Task: A baseline combining deep feature embeddings across datasets

Written by Sergio Oramas, Dmitry Bogdanov, Alastair Porter

Presented MediaEvalâ€™18, 29-31 October 2018, Sophia Antipolis, France

## Available Resources

AcousticBrainz Genre Task site: [(link)](https://multimediaeval.github.io/2018-AcousticBrainz-Genre-Task/)

Baseline Implementation: [Github Repository (link)](https://github.com/MTG/acousticbrainz-mediaeval-baselines)
which links to a specific version of Sergio Oramas Github Repo "Tartarus".

Datasets: Zenodo
[Ground truth (restricted)](https://zenodo.org/record/2554044)
[Genre annotations](https://zenodo.org/record/2553414)


## Reproducability #1

Linked Github repo "Tartarus" does suggest 3 different experiments for other datasets/papers.

Idea: Identify the most identical experiment and try to reproduce with AcousticBrainz dataset.

Kindly asked main author to provide a bit more information how to run.

## Reproducability #2

Loading datasets of other experiments cumbersome
- MSD-A: Million Song Dataset for Artists gDrive
- MuMu: Multimodal Music Dataset v3 (MSD + Amazon Reviews + MusicBrainz)
- MSD-I: Audio,images and genre annotations

Only 2 out of 3 experiments even starts.

<!-- ## Reproducability #3 -->

<!-- Try to identify experiment based on task/dataset similarity. -->

<!-- Run the other experiments is the same as mentioned in paper. -->

## Outlook

Wait for feedback of author.

Meanwhile: Try to apply code of referenced experiments to our dataset.

## End
